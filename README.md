JS Car game
This project is an HTML-based car game that allows users to control a car on a virtual road while avoiding collision with enemy cars. The game interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game starts with a start screen that displays a "Start" button. When the user clicks the button, the game begins. A background image representing a road is displayed, creating an immersive environment for the game.

The player's car is represented by a top-down view image of a car, positioned at the bottom of the game area. The player can control the car's movements using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The up arrow key accelerates the car forward, the down arrow key decelerates or moves the car backward, and the left and right arrow keys control the car's lateral movement.

The game area also contains horizontal lines representing road markings. These lines move vertically downward to simulate the sensation of driving. The lines create a visual effect of speed and add to the overall experience of the game.

The objective of the game is to avoid collisions with enemy cars. Enemy cars are represented by small images placed at random positions on the road. They move vertically downward towards the player's car. If the player's car collides with an enemy car, the game ends, and a crash sound effect is played. The player's score is displayed at the top of the game area, indicating the distance covered without collisions.

The game implements collision detection logic to determine if the player's car and an enemy car have collided. When a collision occurs, the game ends, and the player is shown the start screen again.

The game also includes audio elements, such as background music and sound effects. A background music track plays throughout the game, creating an immersive audio experience. Additionally, a collision sound effect is played when a collision occurs.

Overall, this car game project provides an interactive and entertaining experience for users. It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game with dynamic visuals, user input, collision detection, and audio elements. Players can enjoy the thrill of driving while testing their reflexes and aiming for high scores.
